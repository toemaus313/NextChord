You talk about things that nobody cares

      You're wearing out things that nobody wears
D A G5       D       A           G5
      You're calling my name but I gotta make clear

[Verse 3]
     D    A                    G5
When I pulled into town in a police car
D A G5     D     A                     G5
      Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
D A G5       D       A                      G5
      You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
D A G5    D     A                      G5

D A G5     D    A                      G5
      I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
D A G5      D       A                     G5

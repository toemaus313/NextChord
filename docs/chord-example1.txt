[Intro]
Bm   F#7  A   E   G   D   Em   F#7  x2
 
[Verse]
Bm                         F#7
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                      E
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
G                          D
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
F#7
  I had to stop for the night
 
Bm                               F#7
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
A
  And I was thinking to myself
              E
This could be heaven or this could be hell

G                          D
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Em
   There were voices down the corridor,
F#7
  I thought I heard them say...
 
[Chorus]
G                          D
  Welcome to the Hotel California.
       F#7                                        Bm
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Em                                       F#7
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here
 
[Verse]
Bm                            F#7
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
A                                    E
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
G                                   D
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Em                       F#7
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
 
Bm                           F#7
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
A                                     E
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
G                                         D
  and still those voices are calling from far away
Em
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
F#7
  Just to hear them say...
 
[Chorus]
G                         D
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
       F#7                                        Bm
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        G                             D
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Em                                               F#7
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
 
[Verse]
Bm                        F#7
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
A                                E
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
G                              D
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Page 2/3
Em
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
F#7
just can't kill the beast
 
Bm                             F#7
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
A                                       E
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
G                                   D
  "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
Em
  You can check out any time you like
F#7
 But you can never leave...

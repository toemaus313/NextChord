There are delete buttons in the Edit screen, and also in the Song list, whether a single song or a batch of songs are selected. These need to use a common deletion method that will move that song or songs to a Deleted Songs area. I want Deleted Songs added under the Songs header in the sidebar, and we need to have a way to restore songs back from the Deleted Songs area to the Songs area.

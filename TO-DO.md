 PUNCHLIST

  - Detection for tab in parser not working quite right
        -Ex. I Hold On - Dierks Bentley. It is detecting the first line as a title and making it a tag
        - I think its also adding the chordpro-style metadata tags. Stop doing that
  - Make tools
  - Fix Metronome delay
  - iCloud for db storage
- Different UI for phones - sidebar whole screen
- Not refreshing quickly on db changes
- No back button once in a Tag in Songs
- Capo reminder when loading song 
 - Tools: MIDI Sender and MIDI Viewer

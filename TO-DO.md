Now in the Editor: 

When I change the key of an existing song in the editor, I want it to transpose the song to that key. When the Capo is changed, I want it to also update the song accordingly. Saving these edits will make them persistent. 

Lets also add the Convert to Chordpro button to the Editor (it is currently only in the Create Song function). This way users can re-apply our parsing to existing songs if needed
